                <p>Turn your backyard into a luxurious year-round retreat with SunBriteTV All-Weather TVs. Built for
                    permanent outdoor installations, SunBrite outdoor televisions feature a weather-proof housing to
                    protect it from the seasons, and an extra-bright LED screen for a vividly clear picture day or
                    night.</p><br>
                <p><strong>SunBrite TVs</strong> come in 3 distinct series; each uniquely designed for specific outdoor
                    locations, light conditions, and outdoor activities. Choose the <strong>Veranda Series</strong> if
                    you're using in low activity, fully-shaded locations such as a covered patio or screened porch. For
                    higher activity areas with partial sun such as a canopied deck or under a pergola, the <strong>Signature
                        Series</strong> is the ideal choice. For areas that are most active and receive direct
                    sunlight, such as poolside or bar side, select the <strong>Pro Series</strong> for its extremely
                    bright screen and commercial-grade durability.</p>
