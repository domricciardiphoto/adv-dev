                    1) Remove all the items from refrigerator/freezer and throw out spoiled food. Leave an open box of baking soda in the refrigerator for a few days. <br>
                     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wash all removable parts and the door gasket with mild detergent in warm water. Rinse well and wipe dry.<br><br>

                    2) Wash the interior walls and door liner with a solution of 1-2 tablespoons of baking soda to 1 quart warm water. Wipe dry. <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leave the door open and let it air out well, with a fan directed inside. Weather permitting, please also open the windows.<br><br>

                    3) Pour several ounces imitation vanilla (not pure extract) in a shallow saucer, put on a shelf, and let the refrigerator run empty for a few days. <br><br>

                    4) Spread activated charcoal (which is specially treated to remove odor molecules from air) out in shallow pans and put on shelves.<br><br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turn the refrigerator on with a low setting and, if possible, let it run empty for a few days.
