                    charities and organizations in need throughout the tri-state area. We are committed to the
                    communities and families within in our reach and it is our intent that the proceeds from this event
                    be used for the same, and/or similar causes in the future.</div>

                <div class="info70" website="https://www.navysealmuseum.org/">The second Navy SEAL Museum to be built that will commemorate, reflect, and ensure a
                    continuing memory of honor to all United States Naval Special Warfare Operators, who have served and
                    those who have sacrificed the ultimate in service to our country. Their heroism will never be
                    forgotten. Inside, visitors will experience a museum and education center that makes personal and
                    emotional connections to our Special Warfare Operators, and the ideals and values that the govern
                    the SEAL Community. Located in West Sayville, New York, on the south shore of Long Island, the
                    museum's waterfront location is right 
                    <span class="additonal_text">next to the Long Island Maritime
                        Museum. This site, which broke ground in late 2017, offers an ideal complement to historic
                        maritime history that has been on the property since 1966. The museum will be a world-class,
                        state-of-the-art facility and add to the area's already rich array of historic and cultural
                        attractions. Construction is to start in 2018 with completion of the Museum in late 2019.</span>

                <div class="info70" website="https://veteranshome.stonybrookmedicine.edu/">The LISVH team strives to bring the most advanced medical technology and best
                    practices to care for our Heroes. This has helped us earn the reputation as a leader among the
                    nation's 156 State Veterans Homes as well as private long-term care and rehabilitation care
                    providers. Additionally, our veterans truly benefit from our relationship with Stony Brook Medicine.
                    As one of the few "teaching nursing homes" in the United States, we are proud of our mission to
                    train the next generation of physicians, nurses, therapists, dieticians, social workers and
                    administrators as it relates to the care of those <span class="additonal_text">who need skilled
                        nursing and/or post-acute rehabilitation. We strongly believe that no other skilled nursing
                        facility on Long Island can match us as it relates to quality, cost and culture in caring for
                        veterans and their families.

                        The Long Island State Veterans Home provides financial benefits to our Veterans that they do not
                        receive in other skilled nursing settings. We continue to advocate for our veterans both in
                        Washington, D.C. and Albany and recent federal legislation now provides those veterans who are
                        70% or more service connected disabled to receive no cost nursing care and medical model adult
                        day health care in any State Veterans Home. With the average cost of nursing home care on Long
                        Island exceeding $160,000 per year, Veterans can access their VA entitlements and utilize them
                        at our home, thereby substantially reducing the financial burden of long term care.

                        The Long Island State Veterans Home will continue to be faithful to our caring tradition of
                        serving the veterans community.

                    children chronologically aged three (3) and seventeen (17) years old, who have been diagnosed as
                    having a terminal or life threatening illness by providing and arranging special wish requests. The
                    Marty Lyons Foundation has 10 Chapters granting wishes in 13 states: Alabama, Connecticut, Florida,
                    Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South
                    Carolina, Texas and Virginia. The Second Wish Program is to grant wishes to children who have
                    received a first wish 24 months<span class="additonal_text"> prior and have exhausted all medical
                        options and are essentially at end-of-life stage or receiving palliative care. With over 6,500
                        wishes granted in over 30 years, The Marty Lyons Foundation is dedicated in making more dreams

                    In every community, boys and girls are left to find their own recreation and companionship in the
                    streets. An increasing number of children are at home with no adult care or supervision. Young
                    people need to know that someone cares about them. Boys & Girls Clubs offer that and more. Club

                    cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Unsure of his life's direction, a young Danny Thomas
                    sought guidance from St. Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of hopeless causes. If the saint would
                    point to the path he should take, Danny vowed to build a shrine in his name. Success followed
                    Danny's plea and soon after, the legendary entertainer set about fulfilling his vow to St. Jude. The
                    result was St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Danny Thomas officially opened St. Jude Children's
                    Research Hospital on February 4, 1962,<span class="additonal_text"> with the unveiling of the statue
                        of St. Jude Thaddeus. The mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is to advance cures,
                        and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment.
                        Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on
                        race, religion or a family's ability to pay.</span></div>

                <div class="info70" website="https://www.thestillerfoundation.org/">Based on the idea that all children deserve the opportunity to reach their full
                    potential, Ben Stiller founded the Stiller Foundation in 2010. The Foundation seeks to promote the
                    well-being of children worldwide through initiatives that support education. To date, the Stiller
                    Foundation has focused primarily on improving educational opportunities for children in Haiti by
                    rebuilding schools. In the wake of the January 2010 earthquake, the Foundation has supported
                    Architecture for Humanity, a non-profit design services firm, and their Haiti Schools Initiative, as
                    well as the Digicel Foundation, to construct or<span class="additonal_text"> repair eleven schools
                        around the country. Since 2011, the Stiller Foundation has worked in close partnership with
                        Artists for Haiti to support these and other reconstruction efforts. Ben previously launched the
                        StillerStrong campaign in 2009 in conjunction with Save the Children to raise funds for the
                        Cévérine School in the central plateau of Haiti.</span>

                    Charities, which provides critical support to local non-profit organizations that care for Long
                    Island children and families at risk. A fund of the McCormick Foundation, this fundraiser and grant
                    maker has channeled nearly $6 million to local human service agencies since 2000 to help conquer
                    homelessness, substance abuse, illiteracy and hunger. Grant support is made possible by donations
                    from readers and local businesses to Newsday Charities' two annual public campaigns: the
                    Help-A-Family holiday campaign<span class="additonal_text">, which raises money for a range of
                        family service programs; and the Kids Campaign, which funds safe, enriching summer programs for
                        at-risk children. Because Newsday and the Foundation underwrite all of the campaigns'
                        administrative costs, 100 percent of every dollar donated, plus a 50 percent match from the
                        McCormick Foundation, goes directly to dedicated Long Island non-profits serving families in
                        need.</span></div>
